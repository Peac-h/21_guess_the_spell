# Project 21 - Guess The Spell (OOP Project)

Guess The Spell is a simple game where the player tries to guess a spell from the Harry Potter Wizarding World.

The game was developed using HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript. The game logic was implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, with the use of classes and objects to represent the game state and behavior.

The game also employs such programming strategies as 'separation of concerns', 'single responsibility principle' and 'DRY principle'.

The game is responsive to all screen sizes.

**This is my 21st small project so far and first touch with OOP.**

## How to Play

1. When the game loads, a spell will be randomly selected from a list of spells, and a hint will be displayed on the screen.
2. You can guess the spell by entering individual letters using the keyboard.
3. If you enter a correct letter, it will be displayed in the appropriate position(s) in the spell.
4. If you enter an incorrect letter, it will be displayed in the "Wrong Letters" section of the screen.
5. You can only enter a letter once, even if it appears multiple times in the spell.
6. Remember, the game does not distinguish between upper-case and lower-case letters.
7. You have 5 attempts to guess the spell, which is indicated by the number displayed in the "Attempts Left" section of the screen.
8. If you correctly guess the entire spell within the given number of attempts, you win the game.
9. If you're unable to guess the entire spell within the given number of attempts, you lose the game.
10. Your total wins and loses in the game will also be displayed on the screen.
11. You can try another word anytime!
12. And lastly, do not cheat!
